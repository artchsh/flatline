# Flatline — Superboard

Spec for fleet monitoring: a tiny Go agent on each client server pushes system
metrics to Flatline, and a fullscreen NOC-style board shows every client at a
glance. Built for the wall monitor, not the desk: the operator should be able
to see from across the room why a server has high load — or just enjoy looking
at it.

Status: **shipped — Phases 1–4.** See "As built" at the end of each phase for
the differences between this design and the code.

---

## Decisions locked

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Transport | Push only (outbound from client). No inbound ports, no client IPs in Flatline config, works behind NAT |
| Credential | Existing per-monitor `push_token`. No login, no user management on client boxes |
| Alerts v1 | Host-down only, through the existing push-timeout path. No threshold alerts |
| Containers v1 | List + healthy/up + exposed ports. No per-container CPU/mem |
| Editing | In the admin panel (where monitors are managed). The board itself is read-only |
| Board access | Separate page, auth-only (bearer token, same as the dashboard) |
| Board behaviour | Fullscreen, auto-paginating every ~5s (configurable) |
| Agent platform | Go, single static binary, linux/amd64, systemd install |

### Found while spec'ing

Push monitors already go DOWN with "No heartbeat in the time window" when no
push arrives within `interval + 1s buffer` (`server/model/monitor.js`, the push
branch of the check loop). The existing notification path fires from there, so
**host-down alerting is already built** — the agent just has to push regularly
and silence does the rest. No new alerting code for v1.

---

## Phase 1 — Ingest (backend)

### 1.1 `monitor_metric` table

```sql
-- monitor_metric
id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
monitor_id    INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES monitor(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
time          DATETIME NOT NULL
payload       TEXT NOT NULL  -- JSON, schema below
```

Rules, same as the rest of the repo: knex methods, no native SQL. Index on
`(monitor_id, time)`. No FK games: cascade delete is correct here, unlike
`source_group_monitor_id` — metrics for a deleted monitor are meaningless.

Migration: `db/knex_migrations/2026-10-0X-0000-monitor-metric.js`
(validate filename date at write time against existing migrations).

### 1.2 Payload schema (versioned)

```json
{
    "v": 1,
    "host": { "hostname": "client-a-db-01", "os": "linux", "uptime": 864001 },
    "cpu": { "percent": 23.5, "cores": 8, "perCore": [12.1, 88.4, ...] },
    "mem": { "total": 33554432, "used": 12582912, "percent": 37.5 },
    "disk": [ { "mount": "/", "total": 100, "used": 42, "percent": 42.0 } ],
    "gpu": { "available": false },
    "docker": [
        { "name": "api", "image": "api:1.4.2", "state": "running", "health": "healthy", "ports": [ "8080:80" ], "uptime": 86400 }
    ],
    "dockerError": "no docker access (...)" // only when collection failed
}
```

Notes:
- Units are documented once, here: bytes for memory/disk totals, percent 0–100,
  uptime seconds. The agent and the board must never disagree about units.
- `gpu.available: false` is explicit, never absent: "no GPU" and "collector
  broken" must be distinguishable or you will chase ghosts.
- `dockerError` is present only when collection failed, so the board can say
  "unavailable" instead of silently showing "none" for a blind agent.
- `cpu.perCore` is one percentage per logical CPU; `temp` fields are omitted
  when zero because zero means "no sensor", not a temperature.
- `container.uptime` is seconds since start, 0 when unknown.
- Disk is an array (root plus any data mounts); the agent sends every local
  mount it can read, the board shows the fullest first.
- `docker` is an empty array when Docker is absent, not null, for the same reason.
- `v: 1` so a future agent can add fields without breaking old readers. Unknown
  fields are ignored, never rejected.

### 1.3 Extend `/api/push/:pushToken`

Accept an optional JSON body alongside the existing query params:

```json
{ "status": "up", "ping": 12, "msg": "OK", "metrics": { ... } }
```

- Fully backwards compatible: query-param pushes behave exactly as today, and a
  body without `metrics` is today's request.
- `metrics` is validated for shape (object, under 64KB) and stored as-is. The
  server does not interpret it in v1 — no thresholds, no derived statuses.
- A push carrying metrics still counts as a heartbeat for the down-timeout, so
  one request keeps both "host up" and "here are the numbers" alive.
- Oversized or malformed `metrics` → 400, but the heartbeat itself is still
  recorded. A broken collector must never read as a dead host.

### 1.4 Retention

- Legacy pushes retain every sample for **30 days**. Opt-in live telemetry
  retains one snapshot per monitor per **30 seconds**, not every 1Hz sample.
- Prune runs with the existing background-job pattern (hourly, unref'd timer).
- Ten live agents generate ~864k history rows/month at 30-second resolution,
  versus ~25.9 million full payloads if every 1Hz sample were persisted.

---

## Phase 2 — Agent (Go)

Single static binary (`CGO_ENABLED=0`), linux/amd64. No runtime dependencies.

### Collectors

| Source | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `gopsutil/cpu` | percent, cores | 1s sample window per loop, not instantaneous |
| `gopsutil/mem` | total/used/percent | bytes, per the schema |
| `gopsutil/disk` | per-mount total/used/percent | every local mount it can read |
| `gopsutil/host` | hostname, os, uptime | |
| Docker socket | containers: name, image, state, health, ports | list + inspect; **no stats streaming in v1** |
| `nvidia-smi` | util, mem, temp if present | exec + parse, best-effort; failure → `available: false`, never fatal |

### Behaviour

- Live mode defaults to **1-second CPU/RAM samples**. Existing configs with an
  explicit 60-second interval retain it; change `interval_seconds` to 1 to opt in.
- CPU uses elapsed-counter deltas; no blocking one-second sleep per collection.
  Disk and temperatures refresh every 30s, GPU every 5s, Docker every 10s in
  independent workers. Docker events, network counters and history charts remain
  future work. Slow collector values are cached between refreshes.
- A capacity-one pending-sample queue drops superseded samples during a slow
  push. One sender, bounded HTTP timeout, and capped retry backoff: never an
  ever-growing queue of old telemetry. No ±5-second jitter on a 1Hz cadence.
- The monitor's check interval must be at least 3× the agent interval (e.g.
  60s pushes against a 180s interval). Matching them flaps: a push landing
  seconds past the window reads as DOWN, then UP on arrival, every cycle.
- Push failure backs off and then sends the newest pending sample. A failed push
  is *not* reported as host-down locally — silence is the signal, and the
  server already turns silence into an alert.
- Config file (`/etc/superboard/config.json`, mode 0600): server URL + push
  token. Token rotation = regenerate server-side, replace one line, restart.
- `superboard install`: writes the systemd unit, daemon-reloads, enables and
  starts. `superboard uninstall` removes all three. Refuses to double-install.
- `superboard check`: one collection + one push to stdout, exit code tells you
  if the server accepted it. For provisioning and debugging without journald.

### Live transport (agent 1.2+)

- Live payloads add `sampleInterval`; POST `/api/push/:token?telemetry=1`
  enables the fast path. Legacy endpoints/payloads are unchanged.
- Healthy, non-inverted, non-maintenance hosts record a heartbeat at most every
  `min(30s, monitor.interval / 3)`, with a 1s minimum. First beats, explicit DOWN,
  recovery, maintenance and inverted monitors use the ordinary heartbeat path.
  Host timeout/check intervals are **not** changed automatically.
- Latest samples live in a bounded process-local cache (512 monitors); REST
  falls back to indexed durable history after restart/eviction. A restart can
  lose up to 30s of unarchived live samples. This is single-backend-process
  architecture, not a distributed cache.
- `/api/v1/events` streams bearer-authenticated heartbeat/metrics deltas. REST
  snapshots run on connect, reconnect, and coalesced configuration invalidation.
  No roster polling while connected; 30s fallback when disconnected. Token
  revocation, expiry, scope changes and account bans are checked every 15s.
- Freshness is separate from host reachability: live readings become stale
  after `max(5s, sampleInterval * 3)` even when the host timeout is 180s.
- Reverse proxies must disable SSE buffering and allow idle stream connections
  beyond 45s. The server sends 15s keepalives and `X-Accel-Buffering: no`.

### Explicitly out of v1

Per-container CPU/mem (stats streaming), threshold evaluation client-side,
log shipping, anything that is not "collect these six things and POST them."

---

## Phase 3 — Read API

Token-authed (bearer, same as the dashboard), alongside the existing v1 routers.

| Method | Path | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/monitors/:id/metrics/latest` | read | Most recent sample, or 404 when none yet |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/monitors/:id/metrics?hours=24` | read | Windowed history, newest first, capped (suggest 1000 rows) |

- `hours` defaults to 24, max 168 (7d). Older than retention → whatever survives.
- Response shape is the stored payload plus `time`; the server does not reshape it.
- CORS: same `api-cors.js` middleware as the rest of v1, so the browser board can read it.

### As built

- `latest` orders by `time DESC, id DESC`, not `id DESC`: insertion order and
  time order diverge when samples arrive late, and the first version returned a
  stale row because of it. History orders the same way.
- Unreadable rows are skipped rather than failing the window: one corrupt
  payload degrades one sample, not the whole response.
- History is hard-capped at 1000 rows with a `capped` flag, independent of the
  `hours` window.
- `monitorToJSON` now also returns `weight` and `parent`. The board needs them
  to reproduce the operator's intended order, and they are harmless layout
  metadata. This is the only change to an existing endpoint in the phase.

---

## Phase 4 — Superboard page

A route in the dashboard app (auth-only via the existing token gate), visually
distinct from the dense table: this is the NOC wall, not the operator desk.

### Layout

- One card per server (one card per monitor with metrics; group monitors excluded).
- Each compact card: hostname, host/workload status, CPU total + intensity-based
  per-core squares, RAM / disk / GPU / VRAM bars, and a container name/state/
  uptime list. Healthy readings stay neutral; real issues stand out. Exited
  containers are not failures without an expected-running policy.
- Bars are width + number, never colour alone — same rule as everywhere else.
- Fullscreen-friendly: no header chrome in kiosk mode (`?kiosk=1` hides the nav),
  large type, high contrast, works at Full HD and 4K@150%.

### Auto-pagination

- Pages of N cards (fit to viewport, default 6–8), rotating every **5s**
  (configurable via query param, e.g. `?rotate=5`).
- Rotation pauses on any interaction (click/keypress) and resumes after 30s idle,
  so touching it to investigate does not fight you.
- With few enough servers to fit, no rotation happens at all — no empty pages.
- A progress indicator shows position ("2 / 3") so the rotation is legible, not
  disorienting.

### Editing (in the admin panel, not on the board)

- Pairing lives in the monitor edit flow: generate/rotate the push token, set
  the expected interval, link the monitor to its client group.
- The Superboard itself is read-only. No controls except rotation pause.
- What "editable" means concretely: which servers appear (any monitor with a
  recent metrics sample), card order (follow group weight, then name), and the
  rotate interval. All three are board settings, not per-card controls.

### As built

- Routes live in the dashboard app: `/superboard` (with chrome) and
  `/superboard/kiosk` (no chrome, fixed viewport, no scrollbar). A ~40-line
  path router in `src/lib/router.ts`; no routing dependency.
- Discovery is the 404: the board lists monitors, skips `type: "group"`, and
  calls `metrics/latest` for the rest. A 404 means "not a server" and is
  dropped. Zero configuration, and a server that stops pushing ages out on its
  own.
- Card order: parent group `weight`, then the monitor's own `weight`, then
  name. Name is the tie-breaker so the board never reshuffles between
  refreshes.
- Page size is measured, not hard-coded: the board computes columns × rows from
   its own box against a 340×420 minimum and actual card heights, so Full HD
  and 4K@150% both fill sensibly. `?perPage=N` overrides; `?rotate=SECONDS`
  sets the rotation interval (default 5, clamped 1–300).
- Rotation pauses on any pointer, key or touch interaction and resumes after
  30s idle. It also pauses while the tab is hidden. With everything fitting on
  one page there is no rotation at all.
- Snapshots run on SSE connect/reconnect; streaming changes are applied without
  whole-roster reloads. A local 1s clock ages freshness even if the only host
  stops sending. Stale cards retain readable numbers with an amber warning.
- Default page capacity is at least **10 hosts**, even when a tall GPU card
  makes the viewport measurement estimate only one row. Fleets up to ten stay
  together; narrow screens scroll rather than auto-rotating a small fleet.
  Explicit `perPage` query overrides remain supported for custom kiosks.

### Compact container tiles

- Container view uses three columns and three visible rows (nine name-only
  tiles); container uptime is omitted. Full names, state/health and image are
  available in tooltips. Symbols and accessible labels supplement color:
  muted green = running/healthy (or running without a reported health check),
  black = exited/removed with **unknown stop intent**, red = restarting/dead/
  running-unhealthy, yellow = starting/created/paused/unknown transitions.
- Nine or fewer containers remain static. Larger lists loop vertically and
  seamlessly at roughly four seconds per row, without manual scrolling or
  scrollbars on either axis. Hover/focus pauses motion; reduced-motion users
  get a static view. Duplicate loop tiles are hidden from assistive technology.
- Up to six failing containers are pinned, reserving at least one rotating row.
  When more than six fail, remaining failures lead the rotating list; no
  containers are dropped. Docker collection errors remain explicit.
- Current agent payloads do not establish manual stop intent or exit codes.
  Do not infer a crash from `exited`, or label a stop as definitely manual.

### Planned: pending host updates (not implemented)

- Future agent feature: read-only OS package-manager checks every few hours,
  reporting only `Updated`, `Needs updating`, `Critical update needed`, or
  `Unknown / check failed`. No package inventory in the board and no automatic
  installation, service restart, or reboot.
- Use OS advisory metadata for critical severity. Security updates without
  severity metadata should be labeled security updates, not invented critical
  advisories. Unsupported OSes, stale check results, permissions failures,
  missing metadata, or failed refreshes must not appear as `Updated`.
- Consider a separate pending-reboot indicator: long uptime alone does not
  prove that a server is unpatched. Define Linux distribution/package-manager
  support, repository-refresh permissions, freshness limits and advisory
  classification before implementing or deploying this feature.

### Server load history

- Select a server name (↗) to open the keyboard-accessible history dialog.
  Escape closes it; kiosk rotation pauses while it is open. Containers remain
  overflow-hidden with no scrollbars.
- Ranges: 10m, 1h, 6h, 24h, 7d. Only the open dialog refreshes history every
  30s; live board updates continue independently. Range changes abort old reads.
- `/api/v1/monitors/:id/metrics/summary?hours=1` extracts compact CPU/RAM/GPU/
  VRAM scalars, at most 240 chart buckets and 50,000 source rows. This covers
  the full 7-day window at normal 30-second archival cadence. If capped, the
  UI explicitly warns that statistics describe a truncated window.
- p90/p95/p99 use nearest-rank over **archived readings**, not downsampled chart
  averages or raw 1Hz live samples. Missing GPU or invalid values are excluded,
  not interpreted as zero. GPU/VRAM charts describe the first device. Charts
  show bucket averages; gaps are disconnected, and coverage starts at the
  first available archived sample.
- Card `Peak 10m` is the highest observed **total CPU percentage** in a rolling
  10-minute window, not the currently busiest core. A bounded, monotonic live
  window adds no per-push history writes. After restart it warms from archived
  snapshots, so unarchived spikes before restart cannot be reconstructed.
  `cpuPeak10m: {percent, at} | null` is additive REST/SSE sample metadata; agent
  payloads and existing metric rows are unchanged. No agent upgrade is needed.

## Sequencing and risks

1. Migration + ingest extension (shippable, testable with curl)
2. Go agent (testable against the above with `superboard check`)
3. Read API
4. Superboard page

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| DB grows unbounded | Prune job ships in the same commit as the table |
| Agent version skews payload shape | `v: 1` envelope; server ignores unknown fields |
| A broken collector reads as a dead host | Malformed metrics 400s but the heartbeat is still recorded |
| Push token leaks from a client box | 0600 config; rotation is one server-side regenerate + one line |
| Plain HTTP on the wire | Document TLS requirement; the agent refuses plain HTTP unless explicitly allowed |
| nvidia-smi parsing breaks on a new driver | Best-effort by contract; failure yields `available: false`, never a crash |
| Board overwhelms at 10+ clients | Auto-pagination is the design, not a fallback; verify at 4K before calling it done |

## Resolved

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Retention | **30 days**, 30-second snapshots for live telemetry; every legacy sample retained |
| Non-systemd boxes | **cron `@reboot` fallback** with a logged warning. systemd when present; never a silent half-install |
| Kiosk param vs route | **Dedicated route.** `/superboard` (with nav) and `/superboard/kiosk` (chrome-free, memorable wall URL) |
