# Flatline operator dashboard (Vite + React, static build behind nginx).
#
# The backend URL is baked by Vite at build time, which is wrong for a
# published image: the URL is only known where the container runs. So the
# build stamps a __FLATLINE_URL__ placeholder into the bundle and the
# entrypoint replaces it with $FLATLINE_URL on every start. Rebuild only when
# the app changes, reconfigure with an env var.
